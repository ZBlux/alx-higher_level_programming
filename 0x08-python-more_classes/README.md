1. **Why Python programming is awesome**: Python is known for its simplicity and readability, which makes it an excellent choice for beginners. It's a versatile language that can be used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more¹.

2. **What is OOP**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods)¹⁶.

3. **“first-class everything”**: In Python, this means that all objects—functions, methods, classes, etc.—are treated equally. They can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to functions, and returned from functions¹¹.

4. **What is a class**: A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances), providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods)⁶.

5. **What is an object and an instance**: An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object is created from the class, which is an instance³¹.

6. **Difference between a class and an object or instance**: A class is a template for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class. The class defines properties and behaviors, whereas objects are concrete instances of these definitions³⁹.

7. **What is an attribute**: An attribute in programming is a specification that defines a property of an object, element, or file¹⁹.

8. **Public, protected, and private attributes**: These are access specifiers in OOP that determine the visibility of class members. Public members can be accessed from anywhere, protected members can be accessed within the class and its subclasses, and private members can only be accessed within the class²⁴.

9. **What is self**: In Python, `self` refers to the instance of the class and is used to access the attributes and methods of the class within its methods³⁵.

10. **What is a method**: A method is a function associated with a class that defines a particular behavior of a class instance²⁹.

11. **The special __init__ method**: This method is called a constructor and is used for initializing instances of a class. It's where you can set the initial state of an object by assigning values to the properties of the class.

12. **Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding**: These are key concepts in OOP that help in creating a clear separation between the interface and implementation details of a class, protecting the internal state of an object from direct modification from outside the class.

13. **What is a property**: In Python, a property is a special kind of attribute that allows for getter and setter methods to be defined for accessing and modifying them.

14. **Difference between an attribute and a property**: An attribute is a value associated with an object, while a property is an interface for attributes with getter/setter methods to control access to the attribute²³.

15. **Pythonic way to write getters and setters**: Python uses decorators like `@property` to define getters and setters in a clean and readable way.

16. **__str__ and __repr__ methods**: The `__str__` method returns a human-readable string representation of an object, while `__repr__` returns an unambiguous string representation that could be used to recreate the object.

17. **Difference between __str__ and __repr__**: `__str__` is used for creating output for end user while `__repr__` is mainly used for debugging and development. `__repr__`'s goal is to be unambiguous and `__str__`'s is to be readable.

18. **What is a class attribute**: A class attribute is a variable that is shared between all instances of a class.

19. **Difference between an object attribute and a class attribute**: Object attributes are specific to each instance of a class, whereas class attributes are shared across all instances.

20. **What is a class method**: A class method is a method that is bound to the class and not the instance of the class. They have access to the class state rather than instance state.

21. **What is a static method**: A static method does not have access to the class or instance state. It is bound to the class rather than the instances and can be called on the class itself.

22. **Dynamically create arbitrary new attributes**: You can add attributes to instances at runtime by simply assigning a value to an attribute name on an instance.

23. **Bind attributes to object and classes**: Attributes are usually bound to an object or class by defining them inside a class definition or by dynamically setting them on an instance.

24. **__dict__ of a class and instance**: The `__dict__` attribute contains a dictionary of the class or instance's writable attributes.

25. **How Python finds the attributes**: Python searches for attributes in an object's `__dict__`, then in the class's `__dict__`, and finally in the base classes' `__dict__`.

26. **Use of getattr function**: The `getattr` function is used to retrieve the value of an attribute from an object dynamically.
